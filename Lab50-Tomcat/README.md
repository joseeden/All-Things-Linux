## Introduction

Tomcat is a pure Java HTTPS web server environment in which Java code can run. It is an implementation of different technologies;

- Java Servlet
- JavaServer Pages (jsp)
- Java Expression Language
- Websocket Technologies

In addition to this, Tomcat is an Open Source software that is licensed under the Apache license. This means that users can distribute it, modify it, and distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the [Apache Software Foundations license.](https://www.apache.org/licenses/)

**Quick Notes**:

- Tomcat is not officially supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
- However, Tomcat can still be ran in RHEL 8
- Red Hat recommends using JBoss
- Tomcat can also run on Windows 2019 Server
